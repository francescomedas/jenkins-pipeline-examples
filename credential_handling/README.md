 # Making use of secret credentials in a build

Where the use of any secrets such as passwords or keyfiles are required the Jenkins SecretStore capability should be utilized.

This example demonstrates:

 * Requesting a user/password based secret from the Jenkins master and making use of it in a build step.
 * Requesting a secret file from the Jenkins master and making use of it in a build stage
